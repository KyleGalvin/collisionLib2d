## Introduction

This is a C# QuadTree implementation derived from others I've seen and modified to suit my own style and needs.

Also included are primitive geometry methods to determine if various shapes (Circles, Rectangles) are intersecting.

Portions of the QuadTree implementation were taken and modified directly from the Auios project.

## What's contained in this project

The root of the repository contains the out of the `dotnet new console` command,
which generates a new console application that just prints out "Hello, World."
It's a simple example, but great for demonstrating how easy GitLab CI is to
use with .NET. Check out the `Program.cs` and `dotnetcore.csproj` files to
see how these work.

In addition to the .NET Core content, there is a ready-to-go `.gitignore` file
sourced from the the .NET Core [.gitignore](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/.gitignore). This
will help keep your repository clean of build files and other configuration.

Finally, the `.gitlab-ci.yml` contains the configuration needed for GitLab
to build your code. Let's take a look, section by section.

First, we note that we want to use the official Microsoft .NET SDK image
to build our project.

```
image: microsoft/dotnet:latest
```

We're defining two stages here: `build`, and `test`. As your project grows
in complexity you can add more of these.

```
stages:
    - build
    - test
```

Next, we define our build job which simply runs the `dotnet build` command and
identifies the `bin` folder as the output directory. Anything in the `bin` folder
will be automatically handed off to future stages, and is also downloadable through
the web UI.

```
build:
    stage: build
    script:
        - "dotnet build"
    artifacts:
      paths:
        - bin/
```

Similar to the build step, we get our test output simply by running `dotnet test`.

```
test:
    stage: test
    script: 
        - "dotnet test"
```

This should be enough to get you started. There are many, many powerful options 
for your `.gitlab-ci.yml`. You can read about them in our documentation 
[here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/).

## Developing with Gitpod

This template repository also has a fully-automated dev setup for [Gitpod](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/gitpod.html).

The `.gitpod.yml` ensures that, when you open this repository in Gitpod, you'll get a cloud workspace with .NET Core pre-installed, and your project will automatically be built and start running.
